/etc/init.d/soxqd <start|stop|status> [-c <cfg_file>[ -c ...]]
- If no config file is provided, soxqd searches /etc/soxqd/ for config files
  and starts a SoX-queue for each one.

/usr/local/bin/SoX-queue <-c cfg_file>
- Starts inotifywait monitor on queue_dir provided in config file.
- When a file is detected (CLOSE_WRITE or MOVED_TO), the file is checked to
  see if it is audio.
- If it is, the file is moved to the processing_dir and SoX is called.
- SoX outputs to output_dir
- If there is a problem, the source audio file is moved to failed_dir,
  otherwise it's moved to success_dir
