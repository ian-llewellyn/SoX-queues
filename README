SoX-queues is a small collection of scripts that implement audio processor
queues. There are three scripts: a SysV init script called soxqd, the SoX-queue
script that watches a directory for new audio to be processed by the SoX
program (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) and an install/uninstall script to set
everything up in the default places.

With minor modifications, another application could be used to do the heavy
lifting. I like SoX!

Installing
==========
As root:
# cd SoX-queues
# ./install.sh

Starting
========
# /etc/init.d/soxqd start

Configure
=========
# vim /etc/SoX-queues/*.conf

Uninstall
=========
As root:
# SoX-queues/uninstall.sh

Notes
=====
/etc/init.d/soxqd <start|stop|status> [-c <cfg_file>[ -c ...]]
- If no config file is provided, soxqd searches /etc/SoX-queues/ for config files
  and starts a SoX-queue for each one.

/usr/local/bin/SoX-queue <-c cfg_file>
- Starts inotifywait monitor on queue_dir provided in config file.
- When a file is detected (CLOSE_WRITE or MOVED_TO), the file is checked to
  see if it is a dot file.
- If it is not, the file is moved to the processing_dir and SoX is called.
- SoX outputs to output_dir
- If there is a problem, the source audio file is moved to failed_dir,
  otherwise it's moved to success_dir
