To Do:
======
Implement a proper FIFO queue
- At the moment, it is pot luck what order things are processed in on a heavily
  loaded system.

Done / Abandoned:
=================
Implement output format control from the config file
- Bit rate and format would be good - DONE
- The extension of the output file should reflect the format - ABANDONED

Detect if a new file is audio using the 'file' utility
- Decided to let SoX decide if something will be processed or not.
